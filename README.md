A science demonstration for Troy's water

Basically fill an aquarium with water that represents the typical amount of water consumed by Troy during a given period of time.  Then, add dyes in a ppm that is the same as the ppm of certain toxins.

In particular, where the amount exceeds the "safe level", add that amount first, then the amount in excess.
